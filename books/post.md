# Books I've read this year

## The Stranger in the Woods by Michael Finkel

*The Stranger in the Woods* is a biographical account of Christopher Knight. In 1986, at the age of only twenty years old, Knight left modern society behind and wandered into the woods of Maine. He wouldn't emerge for twenty four years. This book serves as a study of the totality of isolation. Both its potential to serve the individual, as well as its capacity to corrupt and destroy the soul.

## Child of God by Cormac McCarthy

*Child of God* is the story of Lester Ballard, a violent man betrayed by society.

## Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson
