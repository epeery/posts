## The Stranger in the Woods by Michael Finkle

*The Stranger in the Woods* is a biographical account of Christopher Knight who in 1986, at the age of only twenty years old, left modern society behind and lived in total isolation in the woods of Maine. He wouldn't emerge until twenty four years later when he was ultimately discovered by law enforcement. This book serves as a study of isolation and its great potential to serve an individual if treated properly, as well as its capacity to corrupt and destroy if its power is not respected.
